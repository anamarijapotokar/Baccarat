# Baccarat

## Overview
This project analyzes betting strategies in the casino game Baccarat using statistical simulation and probabilistic modeling.  
The primary goal is to examine how different betting systems affect expected outcomes, risk of ruin, and bankroll variance, despite Baccarat being a negative-expectation game. While all wagers in Baccarat have a built-in house edge, which will also be calculated for different bets, the analysis explores how various strategies influence short-term volatility and duration of play.
