# Baccarat

## Overview
This project analyzes betting strategies in the casino game Baccarat using statistical simulation and probabilistic modeling.  
The primary goal is to examine how different betting systems affect expected outcomes, risk of ruin, and bankroll variance, despite Baccarat being a negative-expectation game. While all wagers in Baccarat have a built-in house edge, which will also be calculated for different bets, the analysis explores how various strategies influence short-term volatility and duration of play.

## Objectives
1. Simulate Baccarat rounds using realistic probabilities for Player, Banker, and Tie outcomes.  
2. Implement and compare betting strategies, including:
   - Flat betting,  
   - Martingale,  
   - Reverse Martingale (Paroli),  
   - Fibonacci / Dâ€™Alembert systems.  
3. Measure and visualize:
   - expected value per bet,  
   - probability and time to ruin (bankruptcy),  
   - variance and volatility of bankroll,  
   - expected bankroll over time.  

4. Confirm theoretically that the long-run expected bankroll converges to 0 due to the house edge.
